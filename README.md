# Draft of the angular-phonecat tutorial in re-frame #

## Setup ##

Run lein ring server followed by lein figwheel in the directory to see the page.

Each step of the tutorial is in a different branch of this repository (step-1, step-2, ... ). So far I've only finished up to step-4.

The relevant code is in src/cljs/phonecat_re_frame/core.cljs

## TODO ##

Steps 5 on.
